# IBM Data Science
This repository contains hands-on completed work following the IBM Data Science professional certification on Coursera

## What is Data Science
I learnt how the CRISP-DM methodology aligns with the research methods I’ve been using in the mobile computing and well-being field. The course's practical insights and real-world applications, coupled with hands-on peer-reviewed exercises, made it a truly rewarding experience.

## Python for Data Science, AI  & Development
I refreshed my Python knowledge in data structures such as lists, sets, dictionaries, functions Classes, using Pandas, Numpy, string manipulation, web scrapping using Pandas and BeautifulSoup.

## Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
I refreshed my working knowledge of SQL. 🎓💻 It was an engaging experience querying the publicly available City of Chicago crimes, socioeconomic, and schools dataset within Jupyter Notebook, with Python DB-API, pandas, SQL Magic and a focus on SQL optimization. 

Revisiting stored procedures and ACID transactions, brought back a wave of nostalgia from 2012 ⏳ when I was involved in developing the Attendance Management System at Students Loan Trust Fund Ghana 🇬🇭. This reflection led me to read about the evolving role of stored procedures in modern data-driven production systems, weighing their pros and cons, and considering aspects like application testability and the separation of data and business logic.

## Data Analysis with Python
While I have previously used statistical regression methods, including multi-level modelling in my work on predicting depression symptom severity using behavioural data 📲 🛌 🚶‍♂️ 🤸‍♀️ passively collected via smartphones and ŌURA ring [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119222000566), [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.625247/full)], in this course, I focused on machine learning regression techniques. 

I explored **Linear, Multi-linear, Polynomial, and Ridge regression using Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Pandas and gained new insights into Exploratory Data Analysis**.

## Data Visualization with Python
Data visualion is a essential part of Data Science. Here, I refreshed my skillset on visualizing data with Seaborn, Matplot lib.  I also learnt how to visualize geospatial data with folium. With folium, you can do add markers to point of interest on the map and create choropleths that colors or shaped portions of a map based on data.

Below is a visualisation of crimes in the San Francisco Crimes dataset. Markers are clustered together. Click a cluster expand to show the markers within the cluster.

Here, we see a choropleth showing annual imigration to Canada from various countries.
