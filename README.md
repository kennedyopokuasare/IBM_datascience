# IBM Data Science
This repository contains hands-on completed work following the IBM Data Science professional certification on Coursera

## What is Data Science
I learnt how the CRISP-DM methodology aligns with the research methods I’ve been using in the mobile computing and well-being field. The course's practical insights and real-world applications, coupled with hands-on peer-reviewed exercises, made it a truly rewarding experience.

## Python for Data Science, AI  & Development
I refreshed my Python knowledge in data structures such as lists, sets, dictionaries, functions Classes, using Pandas, Numpy, string manipulation, web scrapping using Pandas and BeautifulSoup.

## Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
I refreshed my working knowledge of SQL. 🎓💻 It was an engaging experience querying the publicly available City of Chicago crimes, socioeconomic, and schools dataset within Jupyter Notebook, with Python DB-API, pandas, SQL Magic and a focus on SQL optimization. 

Revisiting stored procedures and ACID transactions, brought back a wave of nostalgia from 2012 ⏳ when I was involved in developing the Attendance Management System at Students Loan Trust Fund Ghana 🇬🇭. This reflection led me to read about the evolving role of stored procedures in modern data-driven production systems, weighing their pros and cons, and considering aspects like application testability and the separation of data and business logic.

## Data Analysis with Python
While I have previously used statistical regression methods, including multi-level modelling in my work on predicting depression symptom severity using behavioural data 📲 🛌 🚶‍♂️ 🤸‍♀️ passively collected via smartphones and ŌURA ring [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119222000566), [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.625247/full)], in this course, I focused on machine learning regression techniques. 

I explored **Linear, Multi-linear, Polynomial, and Ridge regression using Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Pandas and gained new insights into Exploratory Data Analysis**.
