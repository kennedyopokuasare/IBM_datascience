## Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
I refreshed my working knowledge of SQL. üéìüíª It was an engaging experience querying the publicly available City of Chicago crimes, socioeconomic, and schools dataset within Jupyter Notebook, with Python DB-API, pandas, SQL Magic and a focus on SQL optimization. 

Revisiting stored procedures and ACID transactions, brought back a wave of nostalgia from 2012 ‚è≥ when I was involved in developing the Attendance Management System at Students Loan Trust Fund Ghana üá¨üá≠. This reflection led me to read about the evolving role of stored procedures in modern data-driven production systems, weighing their pros and cons, and considering aspects like application testability and the separation of data and business logic.
